### Classification of Coverage Problems

- 1: Single vote. Absolute threshold of 76 or above is resolvable?
- 2: Two votes. Absolute difference of 10 and above 76 is resolvable.
- 3: Three votes. Weighted voting (vote only counts if 76 or above. Take highest quality if absolute diff of 10 otherwise majority.)
- 4+: Weighted voting.
